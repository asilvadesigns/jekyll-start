<p>You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>
<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>
<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

{% highlight scss %}
nav[role="navigation"],
.nav {
    //  Comment goes here
    background-color: dodgerblue;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    color: white;
    @include clearfix;
}

.nav__item {
    padding: rhythm(1) rhythm(.5);
}
{% endhighlight %}
